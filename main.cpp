// Basic Exercises

//     Hello World:
//         Write a simple C++ program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

//     Variables and Data Types:
//         Create a program that declares variables of different data types (int, float, char, string) and outputs them.

//     Arithmetic Operations:
//         Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on them.

//     Conditional Statements:
//         Create a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
//         Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using if-else statements.

//     Loops:
//         Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.
//         Create a program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a while loop.
//         Write a program to reverse the digits of an integer.

//     Arrays:
//         Create a program to find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
//         Write a program to sort an array in ascending order.
//         Implement a program to find the sum of all elements in an array.

//     Functions:
//         Write a function to check whether a given number is prime.
//         Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
//         Write a program to swap two numbers using a function.

// Intermediate Exercises

//     Pointers:
//         Write a program to demonstrate the use of pointers by swapping two numbers using pointer variables.
//         Implement a program that uses a pointer to find the length of a string.

//     Dynamic Memory Allocation:
//         Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers, fills it with values, and then deallocates the memory.

//     Object-Oriented Programming:
//         Define a Book class with attributes like title, author, and price. Implement a constructor, destructor, and a method to display the book details.
//         Create a Circle class with a method to calculate the area. Demonstrate the concept of encapsulation by making the radius private and providing public methods to set and get its value.

//     Inheritance:
//         Implement a base class Shape with a method to calculate the area. Create derived classes Rectangle and Triangle that override the area method.
//         Write a program to demonstrate the concept of multiple inheritance by creating a class that inherits from two base classes.

//     File I/O:
//         Write a program to read a file and count the number of words, lines, and characters.
//         Create a program to write data to a file and then read it back, displaying the content on the console.

// Advanced Exercises

//     Templates:
//         Implement a template function to find the maximum of two values.
//         Create a template class Stack that can handle different data types (int, float, string).

//     Standard Template Library (STL):
//         Write a program that uses an STL vector to store a list of integers and performs operations like inserting, deleting, and sorting.
//         Create a program that uses an STL map to count the frequency of words in a given text.

//     Recursion:
//         Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
//         Implement a recursive function to generate all permutations of a given string.

//     Exception Handling:
//         Create a program that demonstrates exception handling by catching divide-by-zero errors.
//         Write a program that throws and catches custom exceptions.

//     Multithreading:
//         Write a program that demonstrates the use of threads by creating multiple threads that print numbers in a sequence.
//         Implement a program that uses mutexes to synchronize access to shared resources among threads.

// Bonus Project

//     Mini Banking System:
//         Implement a simple banking system using classes. The system should allow users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance. Ensure proper error handling and data encapsulation.
